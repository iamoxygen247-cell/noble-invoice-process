## Azure CLI (`az`) fails with SSL / connection-reset errors behind TLS inspection

**Symptoms (this dev machine, June 2026):**

- `az account show` works (it only reads the local token cache), but any `az`
  command that hits the network fails.
- Without a CA bundle: `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED: unable to get local issuer certificate`.
- After adding the inspection root via `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`: OpenSSL 3.x then
  strict-rejects it with `Basic Constraints of CA cert not marked critical`.
- Intermittently (even once TLS verifies): `ConnectionResetError 10054` during the
  TLS handshake.
- `func azure functionapp publish` and other .NET tools work fine.

**Cause:** a transparent TLS-inspecting security agent re-signs HTTPS traffic.
`func`/.NET trust the agent's root automatically via the Windows certificate store
(SChannel). `az` ships its own Python + OpenSSL 3.x with the `certifi` bundle, which
(a) doesn't include the agent root and (b) strict-rejects it once added. There is no
proxy configured (`netsh winhttp show proxy` = direct), so this is in-line interception,
not a proxy you can point `az` at.

**Why env-var/cert workarounds don't stick:** the MSI `az.cmd` launches
`python.exe -IBm azure.cli` (isolated mode) and the bundled Python has a `._pth` file,
so `PYTHONPATH`, `sitecustomize.py`, and user-site hooks are all ignored. Editing the
install directly needs admin (it lives under `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2`).

**Fix (verified, no admin):** make `az`'s Python verify via the OS store using
[`truststore`](https://pypi.org/project/truststore/), exactly like `func`/.NET.

1. Stage a bootstrap dir (e.g. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\az-truststore`) containing the pure-Python
   `truststore` package plus an `azrun.py`:

   ```python
   import os, sys
   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
   import truststore
   truststore.inject_into_ssl()
   import runpy
   sys.argv = ["az"] + sys.argv[1:]
   runpy.run_module("azure.cli", run_name="__main__")
   ```

   To bootstrap-install `truststore` past the same TLS block, use
   `pip install truststore --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org`
   (scoped to that one download), or copy the package folder from a venv.

2. Add an `az` function to the PowerShell profile so plain `az ...` runs the bootstrap,
   bypassing `-I`:

   ```powershell
   function az {
       & 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\python.exe' -B "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\az-truststore\azrun.py" @args
   }
   ```

**Caveat:** the inspection agent still intermittently resets TLS handshakes
(`WinError 10054`) regardless of the cert fix. Re-run the command, or wrap calls in a
short retry loop. Heavier responses (`functionapp show`, full `list`) hit it more often.

**Alternatives that sidestep the local agent entirely:** Azure Cloud Shell or the Azure
Portal (browser is allowlisted); or ask IT to allowlist `az`'s `python.exe` / supply the
corporate root in a form OpenSSL accepts.

## `func azure functionapp publish` fails: "Unable to connect to Azure"

**Symptoms (this dev machine):** `func azure functionapp publish <app> --build remote`
exits immediately with `Unable to connect to Azure. Make sure you have the az CLI or
Az.Accounts PowerShell module installed and logged in` — even though `az account show`
(via the truststore wrapper) shows a valid login.

**Cause:** `func` shells out to the raw `az.cmd` on PATH (not the PowerShell profile
wrapper) to fetch an ARM token. When the cached access token has expired, `az.cmd`
must refresh over the network and dies on the TLS-inspection SSL failure above, so
`func` sees no credential.

**Fix (verified 2026-07-07):** pre-warm the az token cache through the truststore
bootstrap, then publish — `az.cmd` serves `func` the cached token without a network call:

```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\python.exe' -B "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\az-truststore\azrun.py" account get-access-token --output none
cd functionapp
func azure functionapp publish func-invoiceprocess-westus --build remote
```

The publish itself (Kudu remote build, host health check) is .NET and works fine.
The cached ARM token lasts roughly an hour; re-run the first command if publish
fails again after a long gap.

## `func start` local run: CU call fails with `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`, then `401`

**Symptoms (this dev machine):** running the decision Function locally (`func start` +
`scripts/verify_fn.py`, which defaults to the localhost host) returns HTTP 502 with
`Content Understanding analyze failed: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] ... unable to get
local issuer certificate`. The host, the Azurite-backed ledger, and gate A1 all work — only
the outbound HTTPS call to Content Understanding fails.

**Cause:** the same transparent TLS-inspecting agent as the `az` entry above, but here it hits
the **Python worker** the func host spawns. The `.NET` func host trusts the agent root via
SChannel, but the Python worker uses `certifi`, which doesn't include it. This is not
`az`-specific — any venv-Python outbound HTTPS (the Functions worker, or the standalone
harness scripts) is affected.

**Fix:** make the worker verify via the Windows cert store with
[`truststore`](https://pypi.org/project/truststore/), exactly like the `az` fix. For a local
run, put a `sitecustomize.py` on `PYTHONPATH` (auto-loaded at interpreter startup) before
`func start`:

```python
# sitecustomize.py — on a dir added to PYTHONPATH
try:
    import truststore
    truststore.inject_into_ssl()
except Exception:
    pass
```

`import truststore` must resolve (install it into the venv, or add the staged `truststore`
package dir to `sys.path`/`PYTHONPATH`; the staged location is in `CLAUDE.local.md`). For the
standalone scripts, calling `truststore.inject_into_ssl()` once at startup has the same effect.

**Then a `401` (invalid subscription key):** the CU key hardcoded in `scripts/step21_test.py`
is stale/rotated. Get the current key with
`az cognitiveservices account keys list --name <cu-account> --resource-group <rg>` (run `az`
through the truststore bootstrap above) and set it as `AZURE_CU_KEY` in the gitignored
`functionapp/local.settings.json`. Local storage: run **Azurite** and set both
`AzureWebJobsStorage` and `AZURE_TABLES_CONNECTION_STRING` to `UseDevelopmentStorage=true` so
the ledger stays local (CU has no emulator, so analyze calls still hit the real dev resource).

## `scripts/create_analyzer.py`: `DefaultAzureCredential failed` / `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`

**Symptoms (this dev machine):** a bare
`.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\create_analyzer.py` fails twice over: every
`DefaultAzureCredential` chain entry is unavailable (the `AzureCliCredential` leg dies on the
TLS-inspection `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` above), and even with a key the direct CU HTTPS call
hits the same SSL failure in the venv Python.

**Fix (verified 2026-07-02):** run it with key auth + the truststore bootstrap in one go —
load `AZURE_CU_KEY` from the gitignored `functionapp/local.settings.json` into the environment,
and inject truststore before the script runs:

```powershell
$s = Get-Content functionapp\local.settings.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
$env:AZURE_CU_KEY = $s.Values.AZURE_CU_KEY
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import truststore; truststore.inject_into_ssl(); import runpy, sys; sys.argv = ['create_analyzer.py']; runpy.run_path('scripts/create_analyzer.py', run_name='__main__')"
```

Expected output ends with `status=ContentAnalyzerStatus.READY`. Remember: editing
`analyzers/*.json` changes nothing in the service until this script is run.
