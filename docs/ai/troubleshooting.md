## Azure CLI (`az`) fails with SSL / connection-reset errors behind TLS inspection

**Symptoms (this dev machine, June 2026):**

- `az account show` works (it only reads the local token cache), but any `az`
  command that hits the network fails.
- Without a CA bundle: `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED: unable to get local issuer certificate`.
- After adding the inspection root via `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`: OpenSSL 3.x then
  strict-rejects it with `Basic Constraints of CA cert not marked critical`.
- Intermittently (even once TLS verifies): `ConnectionResetError 10054` during the
  TLS handshake.
- `func azure functionapp publish` and other .NET tools work fine.

**Cause:** a transparent TLS-inspecting security agent re-signs HTTPS traffic.
`func`/.NET trust the agent's root automatically via the Windows certificate store
(SChannel). `az` ships its own Python + OpenSSL 3.x with the `certifi` bundle, which
(a) doesn't include the agent root and (b) strict-rejects it once added. There is no
proxy configured (`netsh winhttp show proxy` = direct), so this is in-line interception,
not a proxy you can point `az` at.

**Why env-var/cert workarounds don't stick:** the MSI `az.cmd` launches
`python.exe -IBm azure.cli` (isolated mode) and the bundled Python has a `._pth` file,
so `PYTHONPATH`, `sitecustomize.py`, and user-site hooks are all ignored. Editing the
install directly needs admin (it lives under `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2`).

**Fix (verified, no admin):** make `az`'s Python verify via the OS store using
[`truststore`](https://pypi.org/project/truststore/), exactly like `func`/.NET.

1. Stage a bootstrap dir (e.g. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\az-truststore`) containing the pure-Python
   `truststore` package plus an `azrun.py`:

   ```python
   import os, sys
   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
   import truststore
   truststore.inject_into_ssl()
   import runpy
   sys.argv = ["az"] + sys.argv[1:]
   runpy.run_module("azure.cli", run_name="__main__")
   ```

   To bootstrap-install `truststore` past the same TLS block, use
   `pip install truststore --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org`
   (scoped to that one download), or copy the package folder from a venv.

2. Add an `az` function to the PowerShell profile so plain `az ...` runs the bootstrap,
   bypassing `-I`:

   ```powershell
   function az {
       & 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\python.exe' -B "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\az-truststore\azrun.py" @args
   }
   ```

**Caveat:** the inspection agent still intermittently resets TLS handshakes
(`WinError 10054`) regardless of the cert fix. Re-run the command, or wrap calls in a
short retry loop. Heavier responses (`functionapp show`, full `list`) hit it more often.

**Alternatives that sidestep the local agent entirely:** Azure Cloud Shell or the Azure
Portal (browser is allowlisted); or ask IT to allowlist `az`'s `python.exe` / supply the
corporate root in a form OpenSSL accepts.
